## 📋 Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating a release, make sure you've:

- [ ] Tested the app thoroughly on your Mac
- [ ] Verified all features work correctly
- [ ] Updated version numbers if needed
- [ ] Committed all changes to git
- [ ] Updated CHANGELOG (if you have one)

## 🏷️ Creating a Release

### Step 1: Create the Release Build

Run the release script with a version number:

```bash
./create_release.sh 1.0.0
```

Replace `1.0.0` with your desired version number (e.g., `1.1.0`, `2.0.0`, etc.)

This will:
- Clean previous builds
- Build the app
- Create a versioned ZIP file
- Generate SHA-256 checksum
- Create a release notes template

**Output:**
```
release/
├── ClaudeUsageTracker.app
├── ClaudeUsageTracker-v1.0.0.zip
├── ClaudeUsageTracker-v1.0.0.zip.sha256
└── RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

### Step 2: Test the Release Build

Before publishing, test the packaged app:

```bash
# Open the app
open release/ClaudeUsageTracker.app

# Verify checksum
cd release && shasum -a 256 -c ClaudeUsageTracker-v1.0.0.zip.sha256
```

Make sure:
- App opens correctly
- Menu bar icon appears
- Data loads properly
- All features work
- No crashes or errors

### Step 3: Update Release Notes

Edit `release/RELEASE_NOTES.md` and fill in:

- **What's New**: New features and improvements

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Code Signing (Optional but Recommended)

For better macOS integration:

1. Get an Apple Developer certificate
2. Sign the app:
   ```bash
   codesign --deep --force --verify --verbose --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name" ClaudeUsageTracker.app
   ```

3. Notarize with Apple:
   ```bash
   xcrun notarytool submit ClaudeUsageTracker.zip --apple-id your@email.com --wait
   ```

**Benefits:**
- No Gatekeeper warnings
- Better user trust
- Required for Mac App Store

### Checksum Verification

Always include SHA-256 checksums:

```bash
# Users can verify with:
shasum -a 256 -c ClaudeUsageTracker-v1.0.0.zip.sha256
```

This ensures the download wasn't tampered with.
